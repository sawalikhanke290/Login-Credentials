# Login-Credentials

To implement a login system using Eclipse, Java JSP, and Servlets, we start by creating a Dynamic Web Project in Eclipse. The user submits their login credentials through a JSP form (login.jsp), which captures the email and password. This form data is then processed by a Servlet (LoginServlet.java). The servlet handles authentication logic, validating the credentials against stored data (hardcoded or from a database). If the login is successful, the user is redirected to a welcome page (welcome.jsp). If not, they are shown an error message and prompted to try again. The web deployment descriptor (web.xml) maps the servlet to handle login requests. This approach ensures separation of concerns, with JSP handling the UI and Servlets managing backend logic.
